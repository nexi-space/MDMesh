/**
 * Android's setup wizard, which a kiosk must not cover before it has finished.
 *
 * QR provisioning hands over to the agent partway through the setup wizard: once `ADMIN_POLICY_COMPLIANCE` returns,
 * the wizard goes on to its remaining pages (navigation mode, the OEM's own). The device enrolls and receives its
 * configuration within seconds, so a kiosk entered then covers the wizard before it finishes. The wizard never
 * records setup as complete and resumes at every boot until someone finishes it, which nobody can do from inside
 * the kiosk. A Device Owner cannot mark setup complete itself (`user_setup_complete` is not on
 * `DevicePolicyManager.setSecureSetting`'s allowlist), so the kiosk waits instead: `config.apply` defers it until
 * [isComplete] (ConfigApplier), and [reapplyWhenComplete] re-applies the configuration the moment it is.
