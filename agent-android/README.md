# MDM Agent (Android)

A from-scratch, self-hosted **custom DPC** (Device Owner) Android MDM agent.
Modern Kotlin: coroutines/Flow, Hilt, Room, DataStore, WorkManager,
kotlinx.serialization + Retrofit.

- `applicationId` / base namespace: `com.mdmesh.agent`
- `minSdk 24`, `targetSdk 35`, `compileSdk 35`
- Identity is a **server-issued device id** (DataStore). The agent never uses
  IMEI/IMSI/serial as identity (restricted post-Android 10).

> Building needs JDK 17 and the Android SDK: set `ANDROID_HOME`, or `sdk.dir` in
> `local.properties` (gitignored). Gradle itself comes from the committed wrapper.

## Module map

| Module | Type | Responsibility |
|--------|------|----------------|
| `:proto` | Kotlin/JVM lib | `@Serializable` wire contract mirroring `../proto/` (`CapabilityMatrix`, `CommandEnvelope`, `CommandResult`, `ProtocolJson`). No Android deps. |
| `:policy` | android-lib | **Capability-abstraction layer.** `DeviceControl`, `PolicyStrategy`, SDK-gated `WifiPolicy` (modern/legacy strategies + factory), `CapabilityRegistry`. All `DevicePolicyManager` calls stay behind interfaces. |
| `:core` | android-lib | Sync/check-in: Retrofit `MdmApi`, `CapabilityCollector`, `CommandDispatcher` (+ handlers), `DeviceIdStore` (DataStore), `CheckInCoordinator`/`CheckInWorker`. Base URL from the enrollment QR (`com.mdmesh.SERVER_URL`, kept in `ServerConfigStore`); `BuildConfig.MDM_BASE_URL` is the fallback for ADB enrollment. |
| `:kiosk` | android-lib | COSU lock-task: `KioskController`, its real impl `LockTaskKioskController` (+ `StubKioskController`), `CrashLoopGuard`, `ExitPinGate`. |
| `:remote` | android-lib | Remote view/control skeleton: `RemoteControlSession`, `RemoteControlTierDetector`, and the **only** Accessibility surface (`InputInjectionService`). |
| `:oem` | android-lib | `OemAdapter` + `GenericOemAdapter` (no-op) + `KnoxAdapter` (PARKED, no Knox dep). |
| `:app` | android-app | Hilt `Application`, `AdminReceiver`, provisioning activities, `MainActivity`, `KioskLauncherActivity` (the kiosk HOME), `CheckInService`, `LocalApiProvider` (the [local API](#local-api-offline-wi-fi-for-the-pinned-kiosk-app)), manifest with the minimal permission set. |

### The capability-abstraction intent

Android is a permanent version treadmill — every OS release adds, removes, or
restricts a policy API. Rather than scatter `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` branches through
feature code, each policy area defines an interface (`WifiPolicy`) with multiple
`PolicyStrategy` implementations; a factory picks the supported one **once**. The
`CapabilityRegistry` reports only the keys that have a working strategy, and that
set becomes the `capabilities` advertised in the `CapabilityMatrix`. The server is
contractually forbidden from sending a command whose `requiresCapability` isn't
advertised, so a 3-year-old agent on Android 9 and a fresh agent on Android 16 talk
to the same server without special-casing. Unknown command types degrade to
`status=unsupported` instead of crashing.

### Permission minimization (Play Protect)

- Base `:app` manifest has **no** `READ_SMS` and **no** `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`;
  package visibility is scoped via `<queries>`.
- **Accessibility / input injection lives only in `:remote`** (and merges in only
  for builds that include it). Its `AccessibilityService` ships
  `android:enabled="false"` and is toggled on only for an authorised control session.
- No phone-state / device-identifier permissions — identity is server-issued.

## Build

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug                                      # app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew detekt assembleDebug lintDebug testDebugUnitTest   # what CI runs (T0)
```

> The Gradle wrapper is committed (`gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`
> and `.properties`, pinned to Gradle 8.10.2), so no system Gradle is needed: the first `./gradlew`
> run downloads that version. Upgrade it with `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version <version>` and
> commit all four files.

Release signing reads from env vars (`MDM_RELEASE_STORE_FILE`,
`MDM_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`, `MDM_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`, `MDM_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`);
see the `// TODO(keystore custody)` note in `app/build.gradle.kts`. The DO binding
is tied to the signing certificate — re-signing a deployed DPC with a different key
forces a factory reset of every enrolled device, so guard the release key carefully.

## ADB Device-Owner dev enrollment loop

Device Owner can only be set on a device/emulator with **no accounts** (fresh or
factory-reset). Then:

```bash
# 1. Install the agent.
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# 2. Bind it as Device Owner (note the .debug applicationIdSuffix on debug builds).
adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.mdmesh.agent.debug/com.mdmesh.agent.admin.AdminReceiver
#   release build would be:
#   adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.mdmesh.agent/com.mdmesh.agent.admin.AdminReceiver

# 3. Confirm.
adb shell dumpsys device_policy | grep -i "Device Owner"
```

If `set-device-owner` fails with "Not allowed to set the device owner because
there are already some accounts" — remove all accounts, or factory reset.

### Getting OFF Device Owner (dev cycle)

A Device Owner cannot simply be uninstalled. To clear it:

```bash
# Clears the DO binding (works on debug/userdebug builds).
adb shell dpm remove-active-admin com.mdmesh.agent.debug/com.mdmesh.agent.admin.AdminReceiver

# If that is blocked, factory reset:
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR   # or wipe via Settings / recovery
```

On an emulator, the fastest reset is **Wipe Data** (cold boot) from the AVD
manager, then re-run the enrollment loop.

## Real provisioning (production)

Production enrollment is via QR / NFC / zero-touch using the
`GET_PROVISIONING_MODE` + `ADMIN_POLICY_COMPLIANCE` activities (already wired). The
ADB loop above is for the dev inner loop only.

After `ADMIN_POLICY_COMPLIANCE` returns, the setup wizard goes on to its remaining pages (navigation mode, the
OEM's own), and the device enrolls meanwhile. A configuration's kiosk waits for those pages: covering an unfinished
wizard would leave setup unrecorded, and the wizard would come back at every boot. `config.apply` reports the kiosk
as `deferred` until then and enters it as soon as the wizard finishes; an ad-hoc `kiosk.enter` sent meanwhile fails
with the same reason. See `UserSetup`.

Pages an OEM adds can be skipped instead. The QR's admin extras bundle may name system apps to hide, comma-separated,
under `com.mdmesh.HIDE_PACKAGES`; the agent hides them in `ADMIN_POLICY_COMPLIANCE`, before the wizard reaches their
pages. On a Lenovo tablet, `com.tblenovo.setup,com.aura.oobe.lenovo` removes the navigation-mode and "setup complete"
pages and the app promoter shown after setup. Google's own pages stay. Hidden apps are not uninstalled, and
`setApplicationHidden(admin, pkg, false)` brings one back. See `EnrollmentHiddenApps`.

The phone's own launcher never shows on a kiosk device. A check-in batch holding `config.apply` runs its
`app.install`s last, so the kiosk starts without waiting for a large download, and the kiosk launcher waits on its
splash for a pinned app that is not installed yet, opening it when it lands. While in kiosk the agent hides the other
launchers (HOME filters at priority 0): at boot, before storage unlocks, Android only starts a direct-boot-aware
HOME, which the kiosk launcher is not, so an OEM launcher would show first. Leaving kiosk unhides them.

That wait can carry the deployment's branding: `com.mdmesh.SPLASH_IMAGE_URL` in the QR's admin extras (an https
address) names a full-screen image, downloaded at enrollment, that the kiosk launcher shows with a spinner in place
of its plain "Loading…", behind the pinned app as it opens and while it is not installed yet. See `KioskSplashImage`.

## Local API (offline Wi-Fi for the pinned kiosk app)

Since Android 10 an ordinary app cannot add, enable, disable or remove saved Wi-Fi networks, or switch the radio.
A kiosk tablet needs exactly that when it has no network at all, so the server cannot be involved: the agent, as
Device Owner, does it locally for the app it pins.

It is an exported content provider that implements only `call`:

| Build | Authority |
|-------|-----------|
| release | `com.mdmesh.agent.localapi` |
| debug | `com.mdmesh.agent.debug.localapi` |

```kotlin
val reply = contentResolver.call(Uri.parse("content://com.mdmesh.agent.localapi"), "wifi.saved", null, null)
```

On Android 11+ the caller must declare `<queries><provider android:authorities="com.mdmesh.agent.localapi" /></queries>`
(the debug authority too, if it talks to a debug agent), or the provider is invisible to it.

Logic: `:core` `localapi/` (`LocalApi`, Android-free and unit-tested); Wi-Fi calls: `:policy` `wifi/WifiNetworks.kt`;
provider: `:app` `localapi/LocalApiProvider.kt`.

### Methods

Every reply has `ok: Boolean`, `code: String`, `message: String` (never the password, never the SSID) and
`apiVersion: Int` (1), plus:

| Method | Extras | Does | Reply adds |
|--------|--------|------|------------|
| `describe` | — | Always answers, authorized or not. | `methods: ArrayList<String>`, `authorized: Boolean`, `reason` when not |
| `wifi.connect` | `ssid`, `password` (may be empty for open), `security`: `open` \| `wep` \| `psk` \| `sae` | Turns the radio on if off, removes every saved network with that SSID, adds the new one, `enableNetwork(id, true)`, `reconnect()`. SAE needs Android 10. | `networkId: Int` |
| `wifi.saved` | — | SSIDs of the saved networks, unquoted, each once. | `ssids: ArrayList<String>` |
| `wifi.forget` | `ssid` | Removes every saved network with that SSID. | — |
| `wifi.setAutoJoin` | `ssid`, `enabled: Boolean` | `enableNetwork(id, true)`, or `disableNetwork(id)` and leave it if Wi-Fi is on it. Credentials stay. | — |
| `wifi.disconnect` | — | `disconnect()`. | — |
| `wifi.setRadio` | `enabled: Boolean` | `setWifiEnabled(enabled)`. | — |

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `OK` | Done (for `wifi.connect`: saved and joining; the connection itself follows). |
| `BAD_REQUEST` | A missing or mistyped extra, an SSID over 32 bytes, a password that cannot fit the security. |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | See `reason` below. |
| `NOT_FOUND` | No saved network has that SSID. |
| `REFUSED` | `WifiManager` returned false or -1. |
| `UNSUPPORTED` | Unknown method, SAE below Android 10, or no Wi-Fi on the device. |
| `ERROR` | Something threw; the message names only the exception class. |

### Authorization

Checked on every call but `describe` (which reports it in `authorized` / `reason`), all of it on the device, so it
holds offline:

1. The agent is Device Owner — else `not_device_owner`.
2. The persisted kiosk (`KioskStateStore`) exists and is `mode == "single"` — else `no_kiosk` (launcher mode
   included).
3. The caller is its `pinPackage` — else `not_pinned_app`. The caller is `getCallingPackage()`, which the platform
   verifies against the calling UID; no extra or argument is trusted for identity.
4. The caller's installer of record is this agent — else `not_installed_by_agent`.

The provider is exported with no `android:permission`: the rule above is the access control. It adds no permission
to the agent (`ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`, `CHANGE_WIFI_STATE` and `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` were already declared), and the
installer lookup needs no package visibility, since an app calling the provider is visible to the agent.

Logcat (tag `LocalApi`) shows only the method and the code. Changes (`wifi.connect`, `forget`, `setAutoJoin`,
`disconnect`, `setRadio`) are also recorded in the event log as `localApi` `<method> <code>` and reach the server on
the next check-in.

### Caveats

- **Installer of record.** The app must be installed by the agent (`app.install`). An app that updates itself
  through its own `PackageInstaller` session becomes its own installer of record and gets `not_installed_by_agent`
  from then on. For development, `adb install -i com.mdmesh.agent.debug app.apk` records the agent as installer.
- **Location services.** Android hides the saved-network list from every non-system app while location is off,
  Device Owners included: `wifi.saved` is then empty, `forget` / `setAutoJoin` answer `NOT_FOUND`, and `connect`
  cannot remove an older entry for the SSID first.
- **`wifiRadio`.** `wifi.setRadio` can turn on a radio the configuration's `wifiRadio` Off turned off (a Device Owner
  is exempt from `DISALLOW_CHANGE_WIFI_STATE`); the configuration turns it off again on its next re-apply.

### Trying it from adb

```bash
adb shell content call --uri content://com.mdmesh.agent.debug.localapi --method describe
# Result: Bundle[{ok=true, code=OK, authorized=false, reason=not_pinned_app, methods=[describe, wifi.connect, ...], ...}]

adb shell content call --uri content://com.mdmesh.agent.debug.localapi --method wifi.saved
# Result: Bundle[{ok=false, code=UNAUTHORIZED, reason=not_pinned_app, ...}]
```

The shell (`com.android.shell`) is never the pinned app, so every `wifi.*` method answers `UNAUTHORIZED` from adb;
`describe` shows which check failed first. Extras are passed as `--extra key:type:value`, e.g.
`--extra ssid:s:Home --extra enabled:b:true` (recent Android versions). `adb logcat -s LocalApi` shows each call.
